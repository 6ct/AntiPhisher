## Why?

There has been a large amount of compromised accounts sending fake messages attempting to phish members out of their logins to Discord Nitro. This bot will filter out all messages containing keywords, regexes, and links from a large set of data.

This bot was originally created for a Discord server with over 10k members. I was contacted by the owner to put together quick bot that would solve this problem. Because this problem wasn't limited to just our server, we chose to release this to everyone on top.gg and Discord.
